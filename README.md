## MaxHeap Class

A Python class `MaxHeap` that supports the following operations: `insert`, `delete`, and `get_max`. The operations maintain the properties of a max-heap.

## Download Content with Retries

A Python function that takes a list of URLs, attempts to download their content, and retries up to 3 times if an error occurs. It uses appropriate error handling to manage different types of exceptions.

## Linear Regression Model

A Python script that trains a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn. The script uses the diabetes dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, and evaluates the model's performance.

## DataFrame Preprocessing

A Python function to clean and preprocess a given DataFrame using pandas. The function handles missing values, normalizes numerical columns, and encodes categorical columns.

## Nth Fibonacci Number

A Python function to compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

## Division with Error Handling

A Python function that divides two numbers and handles the case where the divisor is zero by returning a custom error message.

## Execution Time Decorator

A Python decorator that measures the execution time of a function and logs it. The decorator is applied to a function that performs a computationally expensive task.

## Arithmetic Operations

A Python function that takes two numbers and an operator (as a string) and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

## Random Password Generator

A Python function that generates a random password containing a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Matrix Transpose

A Python function that takes a 2D list (matrix) and returns its transpose.

## Usage
